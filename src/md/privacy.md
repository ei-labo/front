## Your privacy

We use your egg inc ID in some features.
The ID is a kind of credentials to the game server, and it might be used for various actions like examples below:

- Fetch your game progress
- Get all codes of coops you joined

We highly recommend you not to share the id to untrustable, and it's okay you decide not to share it with our service.
Even if you input the id to this service, we promise we don't store your data on our server without permission, and not use it for evilish purpose. The id is used only when you're viewing this site and we keep usage at minimal possible.

Here's our current possible data usage:

- check validity of your account
- read your past mission rewards

And these data are stored client-side for future use, but not used:

- Numbers of PE and SE
- Artifact inventory
- Common/Epic Research Progress
- Contracts Progress

Again, we will not store or transfer these data to our servers without your permission.
