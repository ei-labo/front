## Your privacy

We use your egg inc ID in some features.
The ID is a kind of credentials to the game server, and it might be used for various actions like examples below:

- Fetch your game progress
- Get all codes of coops you joined

And some more harmful actions, which we don't know they're possible or not.

- Shoot down your artifact spaceships
- Take away your all GEs

We highly recommend you not to share the id to untrustable, and it's okay you decide not to share it with our service.
Even if you input the id to this service, we promise we don't store it on our server and not use it for evil.
The id is used only when you're viewing this site and we keep usage at minimal possible.
